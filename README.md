# Movie Theater Ticket Reservation App 

### The application represents a system that can be used by two group of users: 
- Ordinary users that can search for a movie, select an specific theater, view available show times, view graphically available seats, select the desired seat, make payment by 
credit card, receive a copy of ticket and the receipt, via email. Users also should be able to cancel their ticket only up to 72 hours prior to show and receive a credit with %15 administration fee for future purchase up maximum of one-year expiration date. 
- Registered Users (RUs) have their information such as name, address, credit and/or debit card account must be saved on the systemâ€™s database. RUs must pay a $20.00 annual account fee, but they don't have to pay 15% admin fee for cancelling their tickets and will receive the movie news before public announcement. 

### Addition contraints: 
- Only 10% of the seats can be purchased by RUs on a first come first serve policy 
prior to public announcements.
